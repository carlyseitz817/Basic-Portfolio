            I'm Carly. Originally, I'm from Houston, TX, but I moved to DFW for college in Denton. I was there for five and a half years (I double majored and had multiple foot surgeries which delayed things). But hey, I graduated with two degrees: one in Digital Retailing, and one in Fashion Merchandising. Plus, I have a minor in Marketing.

            After graduation, I worked in Carrollton as the internal web gal. However, I was not a developer. Regardless, I learned a lot which is now helping me as I work on making a career change into programming.

            As for my hobbies, I enjoy collaging, painting, thrifting (I sell vintage clothing), and hanging out with my sugar gliders.
